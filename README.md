MacMiner
========

MacMiner is a project built for the Kings College Big Social Data hackathon. It is by no means anywhere near finished. Built by 'Team Norge' (Niklas and George), it is an implementation based on the concept of the MobileMiner in Python for Mac. At the moment, it's far prettier than functional, but it's a working project...
